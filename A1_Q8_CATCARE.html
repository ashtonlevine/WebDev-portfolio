    <h1>Complete Cat Care Guide</h1>
    
    <h2>Daily Nutrition</h2>
    <p>A balanced diet is fundamental to your cat's health. Cats are obligate carnivores, meaning they require a meat-based diet rich in protein.</p>
    <p>Adult cats typically need 2-3 small meals per day. Always provide fresh, clean water.</p>

    <h2>Regular Grooming</h2>
    <p>Grooming is not just about keeping your cat looking good, it's essential for their health. Regular grooming helps prevent hairballs, allows you to check for abnormalities, and strengthens your bond with your cat.</p>
    <p>Short-haired cats need weekly brushing, while long-haired cats may need daily attention. Regular nail trimming and ear cleaning should also be part of your grooming routine.</p>

    <h2>Preventive Health Care</h2>
    <p>Regular veterinary check-ups are crucial for maintaining your cat's health. Annual examinations can detect problems early when they're most treatable.</p>
    <p>Important health measures include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Annual vaccinations</li>
        <li>Regular deworming</li>
        <li>Dental check-ups</li>
        <li>Flea and tick prevention</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Environmental Enrichment</h2>
    <p>Cats need mental and physical stimulation to stay happy and healthy. Create an engaging environment with various activities and spaces.</p>
    <p>Essential enrichment items include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Scratching posts in multiple locations</li>
        <li>Window perches for bird watching</li>
        <li>Interactive toys for play sessions</li>
        <li>Climbing trees and elevated spaces</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Litter Box Care</h2>
    <p>Proper litter box maintenance is essential for your cat's well-being and your home's cleanliness. Most cats prefer unscented, clumping litter in a clean, easily accessible box.</p>
    <p>Maintenance routine:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Scoop at least once daily</li>
        <li>Change litter completely weekly</li>
        <li>Clean box with mild soap monthly</li>
        <li>Replace box yearly</li>
        
    </ul>
