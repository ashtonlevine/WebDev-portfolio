    <h2>Daily Nutrition</h2>
    <p>A balanced diet is fundamental to your dog's health. Dogs require a diet rich in proteins, healthy fats, and essential vitamins.</p>
    <p>Feed your dog according to their size, age, and activity level. Always provide fresh, clean water.</p>

    <h2>Regular Grooming</h2>
    <p>Grooming keeps your dog clean and healthy. It helps prevent matting, skin infections, and shedding-related issues.</p>
    <p>Short-haired dogs need occasional brushing, while long-haired breeds require more frequent grooming. Regular nail trimming, ear cleaning, and dental care are also essential.</p>

    <h2>Preventive Health Care</h2>
    <p>Regular veterinary check-ups are crucial for maintaining your dog's health. Annual examinations can detect problems early when they're most treatable.</p>
    <p>Important health measures include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Annual vaccinations</li>
        <li>Heartworm prevention</li>
        <li>Dental check-ups</li>
        <li>Flea and tick prevention</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Exercise and Mental Stimulation</h2>
    <p>Dogs need daily exercise to maintain a healthy weight and prevent boredom-related behaviors. Regular walks, playtime, and training sessions are important.</p>
    <p>Engagement activities include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Daily walks and outdoor play</li>
        <li>Interactive toys and puzzle feeders</li>
        <li>Training sessions for mental stimulation</li>
        <li>Socialization with other dogs and people</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>House Training and Hygiene</h2>
    <p>Proper training and hygiene are essential for a well-behaved and healthy dog. House training should start early and be consistent.</p>
    <p>Key hygiene practices:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Regular potty breaks and training</li>
        <li>Bathing when necessary (not too frequently to avoid skin issues)</li>
        <li>Keeping sleeping and feeding areas clean</li>
        <li>Providing a comfortable, safe living space</li>

    </ul>
