This project is considered an academic project and was built for a Web Programming class. it required us to build a mock pet adoption site which was slowly built throughout the semester using HTML, CSS, JS, Node and lastly Express. Below is each page of the website and the functions they provide:

1. Homepage
The homepage serves as the landing page for the site.
It displays general information about pet adoption and encourages users to explore the platform.

2. Find a Pet
Users can search for pets available for adoption.
The page allows filtering by pet type (dog or cat), breed, age, gender, and behavior preferences.
Matching pets are displayed dynamically based on user input.

3. Dog Care and Cat Care
These pages provide detailed guides on caring for dogs and cats.
Topics include nutrition, grooming, preventive health care, and enrichment activities.
The guides aim to educate users on responsible pet ownership.

4. Create an Account
Users can create an account by providing a username and password.
Validation ensures usernames are alphanumeric and passwords meet specific criteria (e.g., at least one digit).
The system checks for duplicate usernames and stores user credentials securely.

5. Login and Logout
Registered users can log in to access personalized features.
Upon successful login, a cookie is set to maintain the session.
Users can log out, which clears the session cookie.

6. Giveaway a Pet
Users can list pets they wish to give away for adoption.
The form collects details such as pet type, breed, age, gender, behavior, and a description.
Submitted information is stored and displayed for potential adopters.

7. Contact and Privacy
The contact page provides information about the site owner and how to reach them.
The privacy page outlines the site's data protection policies and user responsibilities.

8. Dynamic and Interactive Features
The site uses cookies to personalize the user experience (e.g., displaying the logged-in username).
JavaScript enhances interactivity, such as filtering pets dynamically and validating forms.

9. Backend and Data Management
The backend, built with Node.js and Express, handles routing, form submissions, and file-based data storage.
User accounts and pet listings are stored in text files (login.txt and pets.txt).
This platform is designed to make pet adoption easy, informative, and accessible while promoting responsible pet ownership.
